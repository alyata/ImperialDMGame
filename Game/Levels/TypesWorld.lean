Title "Proofs as Programs"

Introduction "
!!! THIS WORLD IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION !!!

Oh no! A thief has broken into your house and stolen all your tactics, except for `exact`. You will have to survive these levels with only `exact`.

This is a sidequest in which you learn about the correspondence between proofs and functional programs, e.g. such as the ones in Haskell.

(In fact, Lean is also a fully featured functional programming language!)
